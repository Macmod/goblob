# Goblob ü´ê

Goblob is a lightweight and fast enumeration tool designed to aid in the discovery of sensitive information exposed publicy in Azure blobs, which can be useful for various research purposes such as vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and reconnaissance.

# Installation
`go install github.com/Macmod/goblob@latest`

# Usage

To use goblob simply run the following command:

```bash
$ ./goblob <target>
```

Where `<target>` is the target storage account name to enumerate public Azure blob storage URLs on.

You can also specify a list of storage account names:
```bash
$ ./goblob -accounts accounts.txt
```

By default, the tool will use a list of common Azure Blob Storage container names to construct potential URLs. However, you can also specify a custom list of container names using the `-containers` option. For example:

```bash
$ ./goblob example.com -accounts accounts.txt -containers wordlists/goblob-folder-names.txt
```

The tool also supports outputting the results to a file using the `--output` option:
```bash
$ ./goblob example.com -output results.txt
```

## Optional Flags
- `--goroutines` - Maximum number of concurrent goroutines to allow (default: `5000`).
- `--blobs=true` - Report the URL of each blob instead of the URL of the containers (default: `false`).
- `--verbose=N` - Set verbosity level (default: `1`, min: `0`, max: `3`).
